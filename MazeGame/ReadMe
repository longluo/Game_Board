MazeGame
=================


A game in which a blob-like character tries to find its way out of a maze.
The character starts in the middle of the maze and must find the exit,
which will always be located at one of the four corners of the maze.  Once
the exit to the maze is located, the character is placed into the middle of
a new maze and must find the exit to that maze; this repeats endlessly.

The game is started by pressing the select push button on the right side
of the board.  During game play, the select push button will fire a bullet
in the direction the character is currently facing, and the navigation push
buttons on the left side of the board will cause the character to walk in
the corresponding direction.

Populating the maze are a hundred spinning stars that mindlessly attack the
character.  Contact with one of these stars results in the game ending, but
the stars go away when shot.

Score is accumulated for shooting the stars and for finding the exit to the
maze.  The game lasts for only one character, and the score is displayed on
the virtual UART at 115,200, 8-N-1 during game play and will be displayed
on the screen at the end of the game.
